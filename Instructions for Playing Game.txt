To whomever it may concern,

If you'd like to play the game for yourself, follow these instructions:

	1: If it's not already installed, install Python onto your computer.

	2: If it's not already installed, install pygame onto your computer. This can be done by following the process listed on this website: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted (the command needs to go into your Command 	Terminal) 

	|IMPORTANT|: It's crucial that your chosen method of opening the program (e.g. through Python directly, through an IDE) can access your installation of pygame, as otherwise the program will not open. Although there may be other 	methods which work as well, the methods which I know work for certain are opening the game through Python directly, opening the game through IDLE, and opening the game through Thonny (I'd recommend this one the most since the 	game was coded in Thonny).

	3: Open and run the program using your method of choice. 

	Sidenote: Make sure the 'key' image is in the same location as the program, as otherwise keys will not be displayed correctly (although there is an error handler in the game in case this happens so you will still be able to play 	the game as intended).

If you cannot run the game onto your computer for some reason (I'm not sure whether it works on Apple Macs for example), you can still get a general idea of how the game works through the videos for the Testing section of the document in the previous folder (although keep in mind these videos were recorded using an unfinished version of the game).
