For the project portion of my Computer Science A Level Course, I decided to code a game in Python which would allow middle school Physics students to learn about the concepts of forces in an accessible and interactive way. I also had to write a large document detailing the development of the program (which is also attached in this repository), splitting it into 5 stages commonly seen in Agile software development.

If you'd like to play the game for yourself, follow these instructions:

	1: If it's not already installed, install Python onto your computer.

	2: If it's not already installed, install pygame onto your computer. This can be done by following the process listed on this website: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted (the command needs to go into your Command 	Terminal) 

	|IMPORTANT|: It's crucial that your chosen method of opening the program (e.g. through Python directly, through an IDE) can access your installation of pygame, as otherwise the program will not open. Although there may be other methods which work as well, the methods which I know work for certain are opening the game through Python directly, opening the game through IDLE, and opening the game through Thonny (I'd recommend this one the most since the game was coded in Thonny).

	3: Open and run the program using your method of choice. 

	Sidenote: Make sure the 'key' image is in the same location as the program, as otherwise keys will not be displayed correctly (although there is an error handler in the game in case this happens so you will still be able to play the game as intended).

If you cannot run the game onto your computer for some reason (I'm not sure whether it works on Apple Macs for example), you can still get a general idea of how the game works through the videos for the Testing section of the document in the previous folder (although keep in mind these videos were recorded using an unfinished version of the game).

While there aren't many comments within the program itself, a detailed explanation of how each part of the program works can be found in the Technical Solution portion of the Project Document.

This project taught me a lot about game development and project-management skills, along with strengthening my resilience and time-management skills since I had to complete this project while actively revising my subjects to make sure I was prepared for the upcoming exams, and was a big contributor to the grade I received in the course.
